# Terminology Integrity

* **Never shorten "FermiHDI"**: Always use the full term "FermiHDI" (case-sensitive) or "fermihdi" as explicitly requested. 
* **Prohibited abbreviations**: Do not shorten these terms to "fermi" in any markdown documentation, code comments, or chat responses.
* **Strict matching**: Ensure the exact casing provided in the source is maintained unless a specific format (like lowercase) is required by the task.
